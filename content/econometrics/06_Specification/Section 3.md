## What are dummy variables

In some occasions it can be important to be able to capture *categorical* information. For instance, it may be of relevance to know the gender of an individual, or the race, or nationality, or any other categorial characteristic.

These categories are not numbers. Dummy variables allow to include this information in a regression by coding the categories into 1 (true) or zero (false).
