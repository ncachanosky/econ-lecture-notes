## What is econometrics?

In short, [**econometrics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) is an *economic measurement* statistical technique. Or, in other words, econometrics an economic application of statistical theory. 

Economic theory estipulates *qualitative* relationships. For instance. a demand function can be represented as $Q^D = a - bp$; where $Q^D$ is the quantity demanded, $p$ is the price, and $a, b$ are two parameters. From economic **theory** we know that $a$ and $b$ are positive $(a, b, >0)$. However, economic theory **does not** give values to either $a$ or $b$. Econometrics is the method through which the values of $a$ and $b$ are estimated. If economic theory is **qualitative**, econometrics is **quantitative**.

Note that econometrics uses the values **observable** economic **variables** (such as $Q^D$ and $p$ in the demand function) to estimate what would be a **parameter** in an economic model (such as $a$ and $b$ in the demand function).

## Uses of econometrics

Because econometrics itself is a method to measure economic parameters, it can be used in different ways such as:

* Test an hypothesis
* Make an economic description
* Forecast or predict the unobserved value of economic variables
