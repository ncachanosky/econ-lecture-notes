## What is econometrics?

It is easy to infer a definition of [**econometrics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) from its etymology. The literal interpretation of the word *econometrics* is *economic measurement*. More precisely, econometrics is the application of statistical techniques to economics.

Econometrics is not in itself economic theory. It is, however, one of its complements. Economic theory estipulates *qualitative* relationships. For instance, a demand function can be represented as $Q^D = a - bp$; where $Q^D$ is the quantity demanded, $p$ is the price of the good in question, and $a$ and $b$ are two parameters. From economic **theory** we know that $a$ and $b$ are positive $(a, b, >0)$. However, economic theory **does not** give values to either $a$ or $b$. We do not know, just from theory, how steep the demand line is. Econometrics is a method through which the values of $a$ and $b$ are estimated. If economic theory is **qualitative**, then econometrics is **quantitative**.

Note that econometrics uses the values of **observable** economic **variables** (such as quantities and prices) to estimate what would be the **parameters** in an economic model (such as $a$ and $b$ in the demand function). This is a different excercise from finding, say, an $x^*$ that optimizes the value of $y = f(x)$ with **given** parameter values.

## Uses of econometrics

Because econometrics itself is a method to measure economic parameters, it can be used in different ways such as:

* To test an hypothesis
* To make an economic description
* To forecast or predict the unobserved value of economic variables

For instance, you may want to test they hunch or intutions (the hypothesis) that the point-elasiticy of the demand function equals 1 at a given price.[^1] Alternatively, you may just be interested in what the slope of the demand is at a given price range, so that you can plan your business strategy accordingly. Finally, you may want to estimate what the quantity demanded of a gadget you produce would be in a country where you do not operate by looking at data from countries where you do have business operations.

These are three very distinctive uses of econometrics. These different uses also shows that econometrics, and doing empirical work, is not just about testing hypothesis. Furthermore, this also means that, epistemologically speaking, doing econometrics and empirical work does not mean one is necessarily being a logical positivist (later known as [logical empiricism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/)).
