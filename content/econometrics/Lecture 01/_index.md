## What is econometrics?

It is easy to infer a definition of [**econometrics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) from its etymology. The literal interpretation of the word *econometrics* is *economic measurement*. More precisely, econometrics is the application of statistical techniques to economics.

Econoemtrics is not in itself economic theory. It is, however, one of its complements. Economic theory estipulates *qualitative* relationships. For instance, a demand function can be represented as $Q^D = a - bp$; where $Q^D$ is the quantity demanded, $p$ is the price of the good in question, and $a$ and $b$ are two parameters. From economic **theory** we know that $a$ and $b$ are positive $(a, b, >0)$. However, economic theory **does not** give values to either $a$ or $b$. Econometrics is a method through which the values of $a$ and $b$ are estimated. If economic theory is **qualitative**, then econometrics is **quantitative**.

Note that econometrics uses the values of **observable** economic **variables** (such as the quantities and prices) to estimate what would be the **parameters** in an economic model (such as $a$ and $b$ in the demand function). This is a different excercise from finding, say, an $x^*$ that optimizes the value of $y = f(x)$ with **given** parameter values.

## Uses of econometrics

Because econometrics itself is a method to measure economic parameters, it can be used in different ways such as:

* To test an hypothesis
* To make an economic description
* To forecast or predict the unobserved value of economic variables
