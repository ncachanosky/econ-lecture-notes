In short, [**econometrics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) is an *economic measurement* statistical technique. Or, in other words, econometrics an economic application of statistical theory. 

Economic theory estipulates *qualitative* relationships. For instance. a demand function can be represented as $Q^D = a - bp$; where $Q^D$ is the quantity demanded, $p$ is the price, and $a, b$ are two parameters. From economic **theory** we know that $a$ and $b$ are positive $(a, b, >0)$. However, economic theory **does not** give values to either $a$ or $b$. Econometrics is the method through which the values of $a$ and $b$ are estimated. If economic theory is **qualitative**, econometrics is **quantitative**.
