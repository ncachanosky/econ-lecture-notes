## What does the $t$-test do?

The $t$-test is a s typical test used to test the null hypothesis that a coefficient is different than zero. If this is the case, then the *marginal effect* of its regressors is different than zero and, therefore, said regressor has some explanatory power over the variations of the dependent variable. If the coefficient of a regressor were to be zero $(\beta = 0)$, then said regressor is unrelated with the dependent variable.

A coefficient different than zero can follow in any of the three following categories (number three is unlikely, but not impossible):

1. The regressor is economically significant
2. The regressor is economically insignificant
3. The regressor adds information, but not enough to compensate the loss of degrees of freedom (for instance, $\bar{R}^2$ decreases)

In its most common specification, the $t$-test null hypothesis is that a coefficient is different than zero (two-tailed test), regardless of the sign. An alternative specification would be to test of a given coefficient is positive or negative (one-tailed test).
